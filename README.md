This module is developed to help developers to develop new DNN modules based on their department templates and folders.
This module is based on the DNN Module Creator (http://dnnmodulecreator.codeplex.com/) and DNN Templates (https://github.com/ChrisHammond/DNNTemplates). 
User can add new customize modules to the template folder with more flexibility information.  For example, the module can include the common user role security, display menu items based on the user role, etc.  This module will let DNN developers from different departments, generate their specific modules at specific folders, and their modules can be deployed to the same DNN production server.  Developer can develop same module names for different companies in specific company folders with different specs.
